**Trade: Crypto Analytics Toolkit → Domain or Side Project**

---

Hey Indie Hackers! 👋

I'm starting a fun barter challenge: turn a digital product into 1 Bitcoin through a series of trades. Here's step 1.

## What I'm Offering

**Crypto Sentiment Tracker** - A comprehensive market sentiment analysis toolkit

**What's included:**
- Python analytics engine with 4-dimensional sentiment scoring
- Social media heat index (Twitter/Reddit sentiment analysis)
- Search momentum tracker (Google Trends integration)
- On-chain signal analyzer (exchange flows, holder behavior)
- Volatility-based contrarian indicators
- Beautiful HTML dashboard template
- Full documentation & quick-start guide

**Technical Stack:**
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Modular architecture for easy API integration
- Customizable weights for different market conditions

**Value:** ~$50-100 in dev time + originality

## What I Want

Looking for:
1. **Premium domain name** (short, memorable, .com/.io/.ai)
2. **Side project with potential** (has codebase but needs love)
3. **Design assets** (UI kit, icon set, design system)
4. **Other digital assets** - pitch me what you have

## Why This Trade Makes Sense

- You get a production-ready analytics tool
- Can integrate into your fintech/crypto product
- Open source - modify and extend freely
- Be part of an interesting barter journey

## The Challenge

This is "Code to Bitcoin" - a series of trades to reach 1 BTC. Starting with this toolkit, I'll trade up through increasingly valuable digital assets. Want to be part of the story?
